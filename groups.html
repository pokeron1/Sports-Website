					<div id="1change"><h1>Group A: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Uruguay</h1>
Favorite: Uruguay. Uruguay has advanced past the group stage in four of the last five World Cups, but hasn't won it since 1950. It will be looking to carry on tradition in Russia. <br /><br />
Player to watch: Luis Suarez<br /><br />
At 31, the Barcelona man could be playing in his last World Cup. Coming off a season during which he scored 33 goals in all competitions, he's at the height of his powers and ready to put on for his country. <br /><br />
Dark horse: Egypt<br /><br />
Egypt is making its first World Cup appearance in 28 years and will need a fully healthy Mohamed Salah to have a chance to emerge from its group. If he can revisit the record-breaking form he showed at Liverpool, for which he scored a Premier League record 32 goals in 38 games, in 2017-18, he could be the talk of the tournament. <br /><br />
Best matchup: Russia vs. Saudi Arabia<br /><br />
Picks to advance: Uruguay, Russia <br /><br />

<div id="2change" class="hidden"><div><h1>Group B: Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Iran</h1>
Favorite: Portugal. The winner of of the 2016 Euros should come into Russia with all the confidence in the world. <br /><br />
Player to watch: Cristiano Ronaldo. Enough said.<br /><br />
Dark horse: Iran<br /><br />
It took a goal in the 91st minute goal from Lionel Messi to defeat Iran back in 2014. Iran was good then, and should be even better now. <br /><br />
Best matchup: Portugal vs. Spain<br /><br />
Picks to advance: Portugal, Spain<br /><br />
</div></div>
<div id="1change" class="hidden"><div><h1>Group A: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Uruguay</h1>
Favorite: Uruguay. Uruguay has advanced past the group stage in four of the last five World Cups, but hasn't won it since 1950. It will be looking to carry on tradition in Russia. <br /><br />

Picks to advance: Uruguay, Russia <br /><br />
</div></div>
<div id="3change" class="hidden"><div>
	<h1>Group C: France, Australia, Peru, Denmark</h1>
​Favorite: France<br /><br />
Player to watch: Ousmane Dembélé<br /><br />
The 21-year-old striker who's been underwhelming since making a monster move to Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund back in August. Amid transfer rumors, he could prove he's the world-class wonderkid, he's been billed as while helping lead a loaded French side to the biggest prize in international soccer.<br /><br /> 
Dark horse: Peru<br /><br />
Thirty-four year-old Paolo Guererro is likely playing in his final World Cup. Peru's all-time leader in caps and goals, he won't be satisfied with simply leading his country to its first World Cup since 1982. <br /><br /> 
Best matchup: Peru vs. Denmark<br /><br />
France is head and shoulders above the rest of the competition, so the matchup between Peru and Denmark could be an all-out battle for the other spot into the Round of 16 from this group. <br /><br />
Picks to advance: France, Denmark<br /><br />
</div></div>
<div id="4change" class="hidden"><div>
	<h1>Group D: Argentina, Iceland, Croatia, Nigeria</h1>
Favorite: Argentina. The World Cup is the only dragon Lionel Messi hasn't slayed. He'll have his opportunity one more time in Russia.<br /><br /> 
Player to watch: Lionel Messi<br /><br />
Again. Need we say more? <br /><br />
Dark horse: Nigeria <br /><br />
Led by a roster that includes young, energetic talent, including Alex Iwobi (Arsenal) and Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester City) and veterans such as Victor Moses (Chelsea) an Odion Ighalo (Changchun Yatai), the Super Eagles could be primed to shock some people. <br /><br />
Best matchup: Iceland vs. Nigeria<br /><br />
One thing's for sure, when these two get it cracking, their supporters, some of the most uniquely vibrant in world football, will make the atmosphere extremely spirited. <br /><br />
Picks to advance: Argentina, Croatia <br /><br />

</div></div>
<div id="5change" class="hidden"><div>
	<h1>Group E: Brazil, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Serbia</h1>
Favorite: Brazil. Too. Much. Sauce. Brazil is just too talented and too technical not to begin following up its gold medal in the 2016 Olympics by outclassing the rest of the competition in the group stages at the World Cup. <br /><br />
Player to watch: Neymar Jr./Phillipe Coutinho/Roberto Firmino <br /><br />
Just pick one. Neymar, fully fit, will obviously be the headliner, but Brazil's roster is flush with skill all the way through with talent such as FC Barcelona midfielder Phillipe Coutinho and Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino. Brazil will be a joy to watch.<br /><br /> 
Dark horse: Costa Rica<br /><br />
Costa Rica was given 2,500 to 1 odds to win the World Cup in and wound up finishing eighth. It's got to be thinking it can do what many don't suspect it will again.<br /><br /> 
Best matchup: Costa Rica vs. Switzerland<br /><br />
Picks to advance: Brazil, Switzerland<br /><br />
	</div></div>
<div id="6change" class="hidden"><div>
<h1>Group F: Germany, Mexico, Sweden, Korea Republic</h1>
Favorite: Germany. The juggernaut should run through this group like a yellow light. <br /><br />
Player to watch: Marco Reus. The Borussia Dortmund star was hurt when Germany won the 2014 World Cup, but is back in the fold in 2018 despite returning to action after yet another injury in February. <br /><br />
Dark horse: Mexico<br /><br />
Best matchup: Mexico vs. Sweden<br /><br /> 
Picks to advance: Germany<br /><br />

</div></div>
<div id="7change" class="hidden"><div>
<h1>Group G: Belgium, Panama, Tunisia, England</h1>
Favorite: Belgium<br /><br />
You won't find a side with more proven talent, from Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United) to Eden Hazard (Chelsea) to Kevin De Bruyne and Vincent Kompany (Manchester City) Belgium has no excuse not to contend for the World Cup title. <br /><br />
Player to watch: Kevin De Bruyne<br /><br />
What can't the midfielder do? De Bruyne is one of the most skilled player in the world and likely would've been the Premier League's Player of the Year had it not been for Salah's goal-scoring prowess. Grab your popcorn whenever he takes to the pitch. It's going to be a movie. <br /><br />
Dark horse: England <br /><br />
Don't let a disappointing finish in the Euros, which included a loss to Iceland, England still has a roster that boasts the likes of Harry Kane (Tottenham) and Raheem Sterling (Manchester City), two of the Premier League's top five goalscorers. <br /><br />
Best matchup: Belgium vs. England<br /><br />
Picks to advance: Belgium, England
	</div></div>
<div id="8change" class="hidden"><div>
<h1>Group H: Poland, Senegal, Colombia, Japan</h1>
Favorite: Colombia<br /><br />
Player to watch: Sadio Mane' <br /><br />
The lightning fast striker scored 20 goals and dished out eight assists across all competitions while helping Liverpool reach the Champions League final and has been linked to Real Madrid. <br /><br />
Dark horse: Senegal<br /><br />
Best matchup: Poland vs. Senegal<br /><br />
